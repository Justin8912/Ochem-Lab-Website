For all labs you will need the following: <br/> 1. A Combination Lock <br/> 2. A Lab Notebook with carbon copy capability <br/> 3. The Course Ebook (Access through Longhorn Textbook Access Program)

Canvas is used only for information.  Therefore, I have combined all the Organic Lab sections into one.  You have not been moved to a different section.  The section listed on your schedule is the one you are registered for, so please make sure to attend that section.
